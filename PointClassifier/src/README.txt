In this folder there are 2 java classes and a folder titles "library". In the video, the program you see running is "ThreePointsTest."
The other java class, "DataCreater" is a program I created that allows me to generate new points for the neural net to learn. 
In the video I had a simple ring chape, with 3 layers but you could make lots of different patterns and stuff with it. 
The folder library contains a java class called "NN" which stands for neural network. It's a super simple library I created in a couple days during winter break.
It makes it really easy and simple to make neural nets with whatever shape and size I want. 
Have fun! :D


P.S. I used IntelliJ as my IDE and deleted a lot of the files for the repository to make it easier to navigate. If you want to use this stuff as your own, you will need to do a lot of setup stuff first.
